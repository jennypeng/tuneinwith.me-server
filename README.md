tuneinwith.me-server
===================

Server side for tuneinwith.me.
Made with Node.js and express.

Set up
============

1.  Add the heroku app to your remote
    
        git remote add heroku git@heroku.com:cicadabuzz.git

2.  You're done setting up! When you want to push to heroku just run:
    
        git push heroku master

3.  To push to both just do:
        
        git push && git push heroku master

It might be easier to alias this so it's hard to forget.
